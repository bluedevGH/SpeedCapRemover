# SpeedCapRemover
A mod for Ultrakill that removes the speed cap allowing for more robust gameplay and style point scoring options

This is my first time using C# to do any sort of programming, I apologise if it is wrong or broken!

This is only the source code file, you must compile it yourself for it to run, I will create a .dll release when it is in a functional state that I am happy with.
This mod is completely open source and I do not care if you alter the code or suggest updates to it, feel free!

If you dont know how to compile C# code, do a google search on how to do it using your OS as it varies.
